# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The project was split equally amongst all team members and each team member individually worked on their section, communicating with other team members for feedback and help.  

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Incorporation of mock objects - Incorporating mock objects into our unit tests was difficult as some of the documentation relating to the use of the mockery class were vague. We overcame this by communicating with each other and testing different ways to solve errors that would occur when using mock objects and the mockery class.

Communication and Collaboration – Coordinating effectively as a team, especially with remote members or different schedules, required clear communication. We overcame this by holding regular check-ins and using collaborative tools to keep track of progress.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab document was easy to follow and understandable to our group, we knew right away what to do and what to execute to complete the lab perfectly. This lab was useful practice as it let our group get an experience on using Jira to track bugs as a collective team. Overall, the lab was pretty nice to start us off and what to expect for future labs coming in this course.

The provided lab documents made the requirements straightforward to follow and complete. The index.html file specificed in the lab markdown file was the most helpful to this project as explained the functions and methods in the most detail. Additionally, the lab was a useful experience that helped strengthen our understand of automated unit testing. Finally, our overall experience of the lab was that it was helpful practice on the material that we have learned and how it is to be applied.
