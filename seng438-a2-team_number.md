# 1 Introduction

This lab introduced us to unit testing using JUnit, we already learned what unit testing was during class and this lab further teaches us how to do it. We learned how to apply techniques such as equivalence classes and boundary value analysis while also using mock objects. Through testing the JFreeChart, we gained experienced on how to do unit testing; designing and executing test cases. This helped us identify defects and understand the role of unit testing in the software field.

# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The project was split equally amongst all team members and each team member individually worked on their section, communicating with other team members for feedback and help.  

Lana - createNumberArray, createNumberArray2D
Ron - toString, getCumulativePercentages
Mark - intersects, calculateColumnTotal
John - combine, constrain, getCentralValue, calculateRowTotal

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Incorporation of mock objects - Incorporating mock objects into our unit tests was difficult as some of the documentation relating to the use of the mockery class were vague. We overcame this by communicating with each other and testing different ways to solve errors that would occur when using mock objects and the mockery class.

Communication and Collaboration – Coordinating effectively as a team, especially with remote members or different schedules, required clear communication. We overcame this by holding regular check-ins and using collaborative tools to keep track of progress.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The provided lab documents made the requirements straightforward to follow and complete. The index.html file specified in the lab markdown file was the most helpful to this project as it explained the functions and methods in the most detail. Additionally, the lab was a useful experience that helped strengthen our understanding of automated unit testing. Finally, our overall experience of the lab was that it was helpful practice on the material that we have learned and how it is to be applied.
